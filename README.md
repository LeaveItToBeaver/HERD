Some key things about this application and why I chose the Flutter framework.
> **Future Proofing the application.**
  
  - Flutter is a relatively new framework created by Google alongside the Dart programming language.
  - Every year the demand for software engineers familar with the Dart programming language goes up as more and more companies see Flutters efficiency.
  
> **Seamless integration** with Firebase using the BLoC architecture allows for and incredibly fast client to server connection.
