Some key things about this application and why I chose the Flutter framework
> **Future Proofing the application**
  
  - Flutter is a relatively new framework created by Google alongside the Dart programming language
  - Every year the demand for software engineers familar with the Dart programming language goes up as more and more companies see Flutters efficiency
  
> **Seamless integration** with Firebase using the BLoC architecture allows for and incredibly fast client to server connection

# What I have learned from building this

  - A much better understanding of what it takes to build a large scale application as well as the overhead for mismanaged code
  - Better collaboration techniques as I had a few people helping me build this
  - User authentication security
  - Real Time Database updates using streams and futures
  - How to create a good architecture for your project using the MVVM Design Pattern whilst following best practices
  - Graphic design principals for mobile applications
  
# Where am I going next with this code?

Because of life making it more difficult to focus on passion projects like this, I have fallen behind in terms of keeping the framework up to date.

To combat this, I will be making this repository public and re-creating the entire project from scratch so I can learn from my previous mistakes to make the next version much better. My next version will remain private for the time being, though if anyone wants to contribute to this project, they are more than welcome to.
